## Previous
Working as web developer since 2015. Last year I concluded my college as system analyst, and
for now I just want to develop my codes, but thinking in take a post-graduation course . I'm a coffee
addicted, football player on weekends and now I'm trying to write on blogs about TI and sports, being
more specific, football college/NFL.

My dream is build a coffee machine with javascript!
